This is both the pseudocode and organized workflow for my etch-a-sketch project...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create HTML webpage with basic structure that includes all necessary elements and a
container for the div's that will be generated with JS

Create structure of webpage with CSS stylesheet to align all elements on page and constrict
div container to 960px x 960px

Write JS to take accept user input for number of div boxes to fit into div container. JS will
need to be able to darken div elements when mouse hovers over. Should include a function to clear
div containers (erase users drawing)

    - to start off, have script input div boxes in row then have script input columns from user
        inputs

Add additional optional functions to JS to allow random colors when user selects "random" color
option. Create animation of etch-a-sketch being shaken when contents are deleted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

event listener event to occur when "generate" button is pressed
    function to create div boxes
        takes user input number for width and creates a single row of that length inside <p> 
            element
        takes user input number for height and appends the single row n times until correct
            height is reached
    
event listener to occur when "reset" button is pressed
    function to reset div boxes is called, however the width and height are predetermined at
        960 x 540 div elements.
    function to animate and shake etchSketch block side to side (optional)

event listener to occur when "black" sketch color button is pressed (will also be default)
    function to change div classes to css class that is styled with a black background after 
        user hovers over element
    function to change div classes to css class that is styled slightly darker after each time
        user hovers over element (optional) - ended up not doing this and making more options 
        for colors instead.

event listener to occur when "random" sketch color button is pressed
    function to change div classes to css class that is styled with a black background after user
        hovers over element
