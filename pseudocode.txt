This is both the pseudocode and organized workflow for my etch-a-sketch project...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create HTML webpage with basic structure that includes all necessary elements and a
container for the div's that will be generated with JS

Create structure of webpage with CSS stylesheet to align all elements on page and constrict
div container to 960px x 960px

Write JS to take accept user input for number of div boxes to fit into div container. JS will
need to be able to darken div elements when mouse hovers over. Should include a function to clear
div containers (erase users drawing)

    - to start off, have script input div boxes with something visible in them to make sure code
    is working how I think it is

Add additional optional functions to JS to allow random colors when user selects "random" color
option. Create animation of etch-a-sketch being shaken when contents are deleted.
